# SBD Metallic Debris Collector

Our goal is to design and build a robot that will traverse an unbounded area
autonomously and collect any metallic debris it may encounter. This prject is
sponsored by Stanley Black and Decker and Georgia Institute of Technology.

## Getting Started

Before pushing any code, please go through the full beginner tutorial at
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials. It has a very thorough walk trhough of the
basics of programming ROS.

Also install the linux Ubuntu virtual machine which can be found at
https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/ so that you can interact with the
existing code base for the Ubiquity Magni robotic platform.
